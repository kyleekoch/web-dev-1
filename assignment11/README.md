System fonts are fonts that are already installed on your local device and system.  They are provided by most programs, but not always the internet because of licensing issues.  Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server.  They are not always available on user's devices, but require certain requirements to get called up.  Web safe fonts are fonts that the computer will already have and it reduces load time and could increase performance.  They are font families that both windows and mac should have.

These are important in case the users computer does not have the first called for font.  Fallack fonts will automatically load to the user's computer in case of this happening so that they are still able to see the text.

For this cycle I first started by creating my atom document. I then read through the instructions for this assignment and also went through the course website to figure out what the objectives were for the assignment.  Once I felt familiar with the information I started in on my html document and added in all of my outside information.  I then did my fonts.css document to attach my fonts that I found.  Lastly I started decorating my page in the style.css.  After I completed my work successfully I uploaded it onto github.
