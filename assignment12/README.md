My imaginary client was a woman starting up a cupcake shop.  She wanted her site to be feminine and fun but professional looking.  She also wanted it minimal in design with pictures that add more of a pop to the site.  

Block display is used to create vertical menus of lists.
Inline display forces elements to act like inline elements.
Inline-block display forces elements to respect margin and vertical spacing properties/rules.


For this cycle I read through the directions we had to follow then went to the course website and read through the material to get an understanding of what we had to do. After I completed that I started in on my html and did all of the basic set up stuff, and then the other stuff I wanted to add.  After that I created my nav bar with a dropdown menu, which took some playing around with but I eventually figured it out.  I then started to design my site in css, and once I got a look I felt fit my fake clients needs I submitted my assignment to Github.
